##US Digital Services Playbook Checklist

### Understand what people need
- [x] Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
- [x] Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
- [ ] Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
- [x] Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
- [ ] Share findings with the team and agency leadership
- [x] Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as “user stories”
- [ ] As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs

### Address the whole experience, from start to finish

- [ ] Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
- [ ] Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
- [ ] Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
- [ ] Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service

### Make it simple and intuitive
- [ ] Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the U.S. Web Design Standards as a default
- [ ] Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services
- [ ] Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
- [ ] Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
- [ ] Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
- [ ] Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
- [ ] Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points

### Build the service using agile and iterative practices
- [ ] Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
- [ ] Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made
- [ ] Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
- [ ] Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
- [ ] Release features and improvements multiple times each month
- [ ] Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
- [ ] Use a source code version control system
- [ ] Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system
- [ ] Use code reviews to ensure quality

### Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery - N/A
- [ ] Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities
- [ ] Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones
- [ ] Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables
- [ ] Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves
- [ ] Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made
- [ ] Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law
- [ ] Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services
- [ ] Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government
- [ ] Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan

### Assign one leader and hold that person accountable
- [x] A product owner has been identified
- [x] All stakeholders agree that the product owner has the authority to assign tasks and make decisions about features and technical implementation details
- [x] The product owner has a product management background with technical experience to assess alternatives and weigh tradeoffs
- [ ] The product owner has a work plan that includes budget estimates and identifies funding sources
- [ ] The product owner has a strong relationship with the contracting officer

### Bring in experienced teams
- [x] Member(s) of the team have experience building popular, high-traffic digital services
- [ ] Member(s) of the team have experience designing mobile and web applications
- [ ] Member(s) of the team have experience using automated testing frameworks
- [ ] Member(s) of the team have experience with modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment
- [ ] Member(s) of the team have experience securing digital services
- [ ] A Federal contracting officer is on the internal team if a third party will be used for development work
- [ ] A Federal budget officer is on the internal team or is a partner
- [ ] The appropriate privacy, civil liberties, and/or legal advisor for the department or agency is a partner

### Choose a modern technology stack
- [ ] Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services
- [ ] Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types
- [ ] Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects
- [ ] Consider open source software solutions at every layer of the stack

### Deploy in a flexible hosting environment
- [ ] Resources are provisioned on demand
- [ ] Resources scale based on real-time user demand
- [ ] Resources are provisioned through an API
- [ ] Resources are available in multiple regions
- [ ] We only pay for resources we use
- [ ] Static assets are served through a content delivery network
- [ ] Application is hosted on commodity hardware

### Automate testing and deployments
- [ ] Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components
- [ ] Run tests automatically as part of the build process
- [ ] Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques
- [ ] Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch

### Manage security and privacy through reusable processes
- [ ] Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted
- [ ] Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept
- [ ] Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach
- [ ] Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service
- [ ] “Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP
- [ ] Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable

### Use data to drive decisions
- [ ] Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
- [ ] Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)
- [ ] Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance
- [ ] Create automated alerts based on this monitoring
- [ ] Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs
- [ ] Publish metrics internally
- [ ] Publish metrics externally
- [ ] Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production

### Default to open
- [ ] Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
- [ ] Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)
- [ ] Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver
- [ ] Catalog data in the agency’s enterprise data inventory and add any public datasets to the agency’s public data listing
- [ ] Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public
- [ ] Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost
- [ ] When appropriate, create an API for third parties and internal users to interact with the service directly
- [ ] When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online
- [ ] When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly
