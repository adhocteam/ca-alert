## Contents
The README.md file should also make reference to the following:

a. Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted;

b. Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP DS-AD Labor Category Descriptions;

c. Understood what people needed1, by including people in the prototype development and design process;

d. Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools;

e. Used GitHub to document code commits;

f. Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API;

g. Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0;

h. Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library;

i. Performed usability tests with people;

j. Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype;

k. Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design;

l. Used at least five (5) modern2 and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.);

m. Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used;

n. Developed automated unit tests for their code;

1 The State understands it will be difficult to find people who would be credible actual users of the prototype, given the dataset. “People” here is to be understood as anyone not directly involved in the design or development of the prototype. Subsequent use of the word “People” in all the criteria should be understood to have the same definition as described in this footnote.

2 “Modern” is to be understood as any technology or standard released, created, initiated or finalized in the five (5) years preceding the release of this RFI. Any subsequent use of the word “Modern” in these criteria is to be understood as having the same definition as described in this note.

o. Setup or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider;

p. Setup or used configuration management;

q. Setup or used continuous monitoring;

r. Deployed their software in an open source container, such as Docker (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization);

s. Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine; and

t. Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.
